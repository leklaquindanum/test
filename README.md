# FINALS LAB TASK 2
This Lab Task focuses on transforming an Entity-Relationship Model into a Relational Database with three main tables: Students, Assignments, and Submissions. Each table represents a key part of the system, with Submissions linking students to the assignments they've completed.

## Instructions

1. Create the *student table*:
- Define **username** as VARCHAR (50 characters at max), and as PRIMARY KEY.

2. Create the *assignment table*:
- Define **shortname** as VARCHAR (50 characters at max), and as PRIMARY KEY.
- Define **due_date** as DATE, and make it NOT NULL.
- Define **url** as VARCHAR (255 characters at max), and make it optional (can be either NULL or NOT NULL).

3. Create the *submission table*:
- Define **username** as VARCHAR (50 characters at max).
- Define **shortname** as VARCHAR (50 characters at max).
- Define **version** as INTEGER.
- Define **submit_date** as DATE, and make it NOT NULL. 
- Define **data** as TEXT.
- Create COMPOSITE PRIMARY KEYS which are: **username**, **shortname**, and **version**.
- Create FOREIGN KEYS which are: **username**, and **shortname**.

## Relationships of each Table

A. *student table*

Primary Key: **username**

Relationships:
- *submission table*: One-to-Many — One student/username may have Many submissions.

B. *assignment table*

Primary Key: **shortname**

Relationships:
- *submission table*: One-to-Many — One assignment/shortname may have Many submissions.

C. *submission table*

Composite Primary Key: **username, shortname, version**

Relationships:
- *student table*: Many-to-One — Each submission came from one student.
- *assignment table*: Many-to-One — Each submission came from one assignment.

### NOTE:
*This Relational Model is a **Many-to-Many** relationship between **students** and **assignments**; while **version** is tracing many submissions.*
